It allows for a deeper understanding of the platform especially if there is a steep learning curve such as in A12. I feel like we couldn't even closely test out the real potential of A12, just because there wasn't enough time to understand and try out all the documentation material.; Montigem was very easy to get into especially with the slack support. An easier installation would help.
A12 has a big hurdle to get into. You're bombarded with documentation to a degree where you first have to understand the structure of the docu itself before you can start n the platform. 
Both platforms have their difficulties with encapsulated entities and multiplicities. I did expect this to be handled better, since that is what models are about. (Showing entities within entities within entities with multiplicity >1).";49;165;157;532;486;1232;;2021-08-23 11:16:37;1;0;5;5;2;1;0,59;2

it is easy to transfer knowledge from an example project to a new project as the code also describes the way how to implement it, in visual editors you see the result and a example project can show you what is possible but the way to get there is hidden.";Once you get a grasp of the menus and how to use a tool, also domain experts without programming knowledge are able to help in the development process;5;5;1;1;5;5;1;3;5;1;5;5;5;3;4;5;1;3;4;5;5;"Documentation,
In A12 and montigem the manual processes are often repeditive and should be possible to further automate the process (A12 has developed a new tool consolidating some of there application, but at the time of our LCpraktikum this is the conclusion I come to, and even when the one modeller is incorporated to the other there is still some copying of files between A12 Applications I do not understand)";"Additional UI support and accessing the model code to create a own repartoire. It seem that both frameworks have a bit of an identity crisis. A12 wants to give you more granular access to the code ( in comparison to pure visual low/code /no code platform) but it does not let you use the plattform to build your own component ""forks"". You are stuck to building react components and using these to build your application. But well written react components can to the same thing... it seems to me I would choose plain react and just the form/ validation engine of A12. The rest feels really restrictive and it seems to me it will not be sustainable, if react has new features A12 will not be able to support the features and is not inetrateble to existing react applications, which also seem not necessary the web is heavily component based and A12 should be able to isolate itself without corrupting the React base library (stencil and other wbcomponent based frameworks are able to create good abstractions without breaking or restricting a framework)";4;4;5;5;Poor documentation, the lap supervisors often seemed unprepared. Though they had a good commitment when having problems. But it seemed to me that the goal was: Yes let them build an app in A12 and one Montigem and we will be there if some questions are asked. It seems a better Praktikums plan structure, consolidated informations, a moodle room, a consistent calendar entry / zoom meeting have to mandatory. It was a 7 Credit university course. I fully see the time I put in, but it seems 50% of the time could have been used for enhancing our code if the praktikum would have been structured correctly. The 7Crt did not transfer to the commitment the supervisors put into the Praktikum;;2;29;118;873;314;1336;;2021-08-27 11:05:13;1;0;5;5;5;3;1,45;47
